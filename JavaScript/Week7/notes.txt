Fetch API - another way of doing asynchronous programming in JS
    Fetch API uses "Promises"!

What is a promise?
    In ES5/ES6 JS, promise is just like a real world promise:
    We make promises! Either we fulfil them OR we do not fulfil them!
    
    If a promise is fulfilled in JS, it means it is "resolve()"
    If a promise is NOT fulfilled in JS, it means it is "reject()"

    In async progrmaming, we actually wait for some promises (to be either resolved OR rejected before we continute our execution of next codes)

fetch API is more widely used for asynchronous communication...
